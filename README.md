# enigma_mod1
Final project for mod 1


- Funtionality: My project meets expectations. Encrypt and decrypt run smoothly and the command line
interface works

- Object Oriented Programming: I'd say it meets expectations. I created classes specifically for encrypt and decrypt
and potentially reaches above expectations since I included inheritance.

- Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: My conventions meet expectations. I tried to name things specific to their function
and included a hash for both the encrypt message and decrypt message classes. These are also passed to the enigma class methods
encrypt and decrypt.

- TDD: I would say I am between meets expectations and below expectations because I could have included more
tests for the entire functionality for my methods. I did include one mock/stub in my cryptor class to show that
it can accept a message from the shifter class, and coverage is 100%.

- Version Control: I would say I am above expectations for version control. I have over 40 commits and over 4 pull requests
